# TodoList
This is a JavaFX application made during the Java Programming Masterclass for Software Developers by Tim Buchalka.  
The application lets you add Todo items to a Todo List.  
It is currently finished as far as the coding exercise goes.  
The application still has some bugs which would be fixed in a real-world application, but they are left due to this was made as a coding exercise.  
# Bugs
User input is not controlled, the application has not been tested with no items, the application comes with pre-loaded todo items due to testing, and more features could have been implemented.
